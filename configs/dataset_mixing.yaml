# MUSE Dataset Mixing Configuration
# Defines the curriculum learning ratios for the "Ab Initio" training phase.
# UPDATED: "Teppei's High-Density Curriculum" (OSS/Privacy-First Edition)

# Strategy:
# 1. The Brain (Logic/Reasoning) -> 45%
#    - Uses "Cosmopedia" (Synthetic Textbooks) to teach the "WHY" and "HOW".
# 2. The Hands (Engineering/Code) -> 30%
#    - Uses "Evol-Instruct" to teach complex implementation details.
# 3. The Soul (Culture/Empathy) -> 15%
#    - Uses Japanese Wiki and Dialogue to ensure cultural grounding and politeness.
# 4. The World (Physics/Facts) -> 10%
#    - ArXiv and Wiki Factuality for grounding in physical reality.
