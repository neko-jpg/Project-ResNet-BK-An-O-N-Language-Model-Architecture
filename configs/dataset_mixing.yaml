# MUSE Dataset Mixing Configuration
# Defines the curriculum learning ratios for the "Ab Initio" training phase.

# Strategy:
# 1. Establish Base Logic (Code + Math + English Wiki) -> 50%
# 2. Inject Engineering Reality (Instruction Code + Refactoring) -> 20%
# 3. Inject Physics & Facts (ArXiv + Factuality) -> 15%
# 4. Inject Culture & Empathy (Japanese + Dialogue + Sarcasm) -> 15%
