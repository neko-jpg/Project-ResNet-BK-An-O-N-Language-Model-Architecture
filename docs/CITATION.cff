  abstract: |
    We present ResNet-BK, a novel O(N) language model architecture based on 
    Birman-Schwinger operator theory that surpasses Mamba across three critical 
    dimensions: long-context stability (up to 1M tokens), quantization robustness 
    (4× lower perplexity at INT4), and dynamic compute efficiency (2× fewer FLOPs 
    at equal perplexity). Our approach leverages rigorous mathematical foundations 
    including trace-class operators, Mourre estimates, and Limiting Absorption 
    Principle to guarantee numerical stability. We introduce Prime-Bump initialization 
    based on Riemann zeta function zeros, parameter-free scattering-based routing, 
    and semiseparable matrix structure for O(N log N) memory complexity. Extensive 
    benchmarks demonstrate that ResNet-BK maintains stable training on sequences 
    up to 1M tokens while Mamba diverges at 32k, achieves 10% lower quantization 
    error at INT8 and 20% at INT4, and requires 40% fewer FLOPs with adaptive 
    computation. We provide complete reproducibility package including Docker 
    containers, Google Colab notebooks, and pre-trained checkpoints.
