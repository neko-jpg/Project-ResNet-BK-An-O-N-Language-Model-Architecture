# Checkpoint Saver Configuration
# 
# This daemon watches for new checkpoint files and:
# 1. Deletes old checkpoints (keeps only latest N)
# 2. Optionally compresses checkpoints with zstd
#
# Run: cargo run --release -- --config config.toml

[watcher]
# Directory to watch for checkpoint files
path = "checkpoints/phase8_10b_japanese"
# Glob pattern for checkpoint files
pattern = "step_*.pt"

[cleanup]
# Number of latest checkpoints to keep
keep_latest = 2

[compression]
# Enable zstd compression (saves 50-70% disk space)
enabled = true
# Compression level (1-22, higher = smaller but slower)
# Recommended: 3 for balance, 1 for speed, 9+ for maximum compression
level = 3
